# Smoking and Gender Analysis Project

## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze a Kaggle dataset to determine what factors increase the cost of healthcare insurance. I will investigate all factors but I tend to investigate how much a higher BMI and smoking increases your insurance costs. I will then have a Random Forest model predict these charges and compare them to the actual charges. 

## Dataset Information

- **Dataset Name**: Healthcare Insurance
- **Dataset Source**: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/willianoliveiragibin/healthcare-insurance/
- **Dataset Description**: This dataset contains information on the relationship between personal attributes (age, gender, BMI, family size, smoking habits), geographic factors, and their impact on medical insurance charges. It can be used to study how these features influence insurance costs and develop predictive models for estimating healthcare expenses.
Age: The insured person's age.

Sex: Gender (male or female) of the insured.

BMI (Body Mass Index): A measure of body fat based on height and weight.

Children: The number of dependents covered.

Smoker: Whether the insured is a smoker (yes or no).

Region: The geographic area of coverage.

Charges: The medical insurance costs incurred by the insured person.

## Analysis Goals

- To determine the cost of insurance based on the available attributes (Age, BMI, Smoker (y/n), Region,)


## Data Preprocessing

- Data Cleaning: Done in part 2
- Feature Selection: Done in part 2/3

## Methodology

- Models Used: Linear regression, Random Forest
- Evaluation Metrics: Age, BMI, Smoker (y/n), Region, Children
## Results

- TBD

## Conclusion

- TBD
